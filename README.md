# Simple++/SimplePlusPlus
Simple++ is a hybrid modular application, designed primarily for desktop and tablet browsers, focusing on delivering a healthcare system
for elderly users. Developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Node.js, it uses Phonegap to deploy to mobile devices.

The inspiration behind this project is the application +Simple developed by Buenos Aires Ciudad - check it out at http://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/desarrollohumanoyhabitat/personasmayores/massimple

The main features focus on accessibility - high contrast colours, resizable text and responsive design. The main backend architecture focuses
on modularity - each of the usable modules are functionally independent and do not need updating when the underlying framework is updated.
The backend architecture uses EJS to render each page in real time, providing a great solution for separating the code into modules.

To run, simply start the local server using server.js via terminal and navigate to localhost:3000.
